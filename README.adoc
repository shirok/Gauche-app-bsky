= Gauche Bluesky API library

A convenience library to access link:https://bsky.app/[Bluesky] API.

== Prerequisites

link:https://practical-scheme.net/gauche[Gauche] 0.9.13 or later

You need to have Bluesky handle and its app password.  The first thing
you do is to call `make-bsky-session` with those parameters to obtain
a `<bsky-session>` object, which can be used for subsequent API calls.

== API

=== Creating a session

`(make-bsky-session :optional handle app-password)` accesses `bsky.app`
to get a session token.  Returns `<bsky-session>` on success.
Throws `<bsky-error>` condition if something goes wrong.

If _handle_ and/or _app-password_ is omitted, values of the environment
variable `GAUCHE_BSKY_HANDLE` and `GAUCHE_BSKY_APP_PASSWORD`
are used, respectively.


=== Posting a text

Currently, only a simple text posting is supported.

`(bsky-post-text session text :key created-at)` posts _text_.
